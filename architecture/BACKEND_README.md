## 1. System Architecture & Design Philosophy

### Modular Monolith with Microservice-Ready Boundaries

- **Highly modular codebase**: Each domain (student, teacher, organization, admin, utility) is isolated into its own controller, service, model, and route structure, enabling easy scaling or migration to microservices.
- **Plug-and-play AI/LLM layer**: The architecture is designed to support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, AWS Bedrock, custom/finetuned models) with a simple configuration switch—future-proofing for rapid AI innovation.
- **Real-time, event-driven core**: WebSocket infrastructure supports multiple channels, event types, and user roles, enabling live classroom, chat, notification, and collaborative features.

### Technology Stack

| Layer         | Technology/Pattern                | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| Language      | TypeScript (Node.js)              | Strict typing, async/await, modern ES features |
| Web Framework | Express.js                        | RESTful, middleware-driven |
| Real-time     | WebSockets (custom, multi-channel)| Multi-room, pub/sub, event multiplexing |
| Database      | MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)            | Flexible schema, high throughput |
| Caching/Queue | Redis                             | Session, pub/sub, background jobs |
| File Storage  | AWS S3 (abstracted)               | Secure, scalable, pluggable |
| Email         | Nodemailer                        | Templated, async, multi-provider |
| AI/LLM        | Configurable (OpenAI, Claude, etc)| Pluggable, future-ready |
| Validation    | Zod/Joi schemas                   | Strict, layered validation |
| Logging       | Centralized, structured           | Audit, error, access logs |

### Key Architectural Features

- **Environment-driven config**: All secrets, endpoints, and feature toggles are managed via environment variables and config files for maximum portability and security.
- **Custom middleware stack**: Auth, file upload, error handling, and AI-specific middlewares are easily extendable.
- **Automatic tool customization**: The backend can dynamically enable/disable features (e.g., AI grader, HW generator, media referencing) per deployment or tenant.

---

## 2. Real-Time & WebSocket Engine

### Multi-Channel, Multi-Role WebSocket System

- **Channel-based architecture**: Each classroom, thread, or group operates in its own channel, supporting isolated real-time events.
- **Role-aware events**: Teachers, students, and admins receive tailored event streams (e.g., live grading, attendance, chat, notifications).
- **Scalable pub/sub**: Redis-backed pub/sub ensures horizontal scalability and low-latency delivery across distributed instances.
- **Custom event types**: Supports chat, file uploads, AI feedback, live quizzes, collaborative editing, and more.

### Advanced Features

- **Background LLM processing**: Media (images, docs, audio) can be referenced in chat or threads, with background LLMs extracting context, generating summaries, or auto-titling threads.
- **Thread title processing**: AI auto-generates thread titles and summaries for improved UX and searchability.
- **AI grader & homework generator**: Asynchronous, scalable background jobs grade student submissions and generate personalized homework using LLMs—fully customizable per institution.
- **Automatic tool customization**: Admins can enable/disable features (e.g., AI grader, HW generator, media referencing) per deployment or tenant.

## 3. Data Modeling & Database Optimization

### Entity Relationship Overview

```
Organization 1---* Student
Organization 1---* Teacher
Organization 1---* Classroom
Classroom    1---* Student
Classroom    1---* Teacher
Student      1---* AssessmentSubmission
Assessment   1---* AssessmentSubmission
Student      1---* Message
Teacher      1---* Message
Thread       1---* Message
Document     *---* Student/Teacher/Classroom
```

### Schema Highlights

- **Strict typing**: All models use TypeScript interfaces/types for compile-time safety.
- **Indexing**: Strategic indexes on org, classroom, thread, and user fields for sub-second queries at scale.
- **Validation**: Zod/Joi schemas enforce data integrity at both API and DB layers.
- **Extensibility**: Models are designed for easy extension (e.g., adding new assessment types, document metadata, or AI feedback fields).

### Data Flow & Caching

- **Read/write separation**: Services abstract DB access, enabling future read-replica or CQRS patterns.
- **Redis caching**: Hot data (sessions, tokens, recent messages) is cached for instant access.
- **Background jobs**: Heavy LLM or grading tasks are offloaded to async workers, keeping APIs responsive.

---

## 4. AI/LLM Integration & Customization

### Pluggable LLM Provider Layer

- **Configurable LLM backend**: Easily switch between OpenAI, Claude, AWS Bedrock, or custom/finetuned models via config—no code changes required.
- **Multi-model support**: Different endpoints or features can use different LLMs (e.g., Claude for summarization, finetuned model for grading).
- **Future-proof**: Designed for rapid integration of new providers or on-prem LLMs.

### AI-Driven Features

| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| AI Grader              | Grades student submissions, provides feedback, and explains answers using LLMs |
| Homework Generator     | Creates personalized assignments based on student progress and curriculum |
| Thread Title Processor | Auto-generates thread titles and summaries for chat and discussion |
| Media Referencing      | Extracts context from uploaded media, links to chat/threads, and generates summaries |
| Adaptive Learning      | Recommends content and activities based on analytics and AI insights |

### Background Processing

- **Async LLM jobs**: All heavy AI tasks are processed in the background, ensuring API responsiveness and scalability.
- **Job queueing**: Redis-backed queues manage LLM requests, retries, and result delivery.
- **Result streaming**: WebSocket channels deliver AI results (e.g., grades, summaries) in real time.

---

## 5. Security, Privacy & Compliance

### Security Architecture

- **JWT-based authentication**: Stateless, scalable, and secure.
- **Role-based access control**: Fine-grained permissions for students, teachers, admins, and organizations.
- **Input validation & sanitization**: All endpoints strictly validate and sanitize input to prevent injection/XSS.
- **Audit logging**: All sensitive actions are logged for compliance and traceability.
- **File upload security**: All uploads are scanned, validated, and stored securely (S3 or pluggable backend).

### Privacy & Compliance

- **GDPR/FERPA-ready**: Data minimization, access controls, and audit trails are built-in.
- **PII protection**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Customizable data retention**: Per-tenant or per-org policies for data retention and deletion.

---

## 6. Performance, Scalability & Observability

### Performance Engineering

## 11. Dynamic AI Feature Handling & JSON-Driven Extensibility

### JSON-Driven AI Feature Management

VedaAI's backend is engineered for **dynamic AI feature enablement and rapid extensibility**. All AI-powered tools, graders, generators, and workflow automations are defined in structured JSON files (see `data/services/student.json`, `data/services/teacher.json`, and `data/services/json_structure_explanation.json`).

#### How It Works

- **Feature registry in JSON**: Each AI tool or workflow (e.g., AI Notes Generator, Quiz Generator, AI Tutor, Homework Generator) is described as a JSON object, specifying its type, input/output schema, LLM provider, credits, UI config, and more.
- **No code deployment required**: To add a new AI feature, simply add a new entry to the relevant JSON file. The backend automatically loads, validates, and exposes the new tool at runtime.
- **Dynamic routing and execution**: The system dynamically maps incoming requests to the correct AI tool based on the JSON registry, supporting custom workflows per organization, classroom, or user role.
- **Customizable per tenant**: Schools or organizations can enable/disable or customize AI features by editing their JSON configuration, without redeploying the backend.
- **Versioning and rollback**: JSON-based configuration allows for easy version control, auditing, and rollback of AI features.

#### Example: Adding a New AI Tool for Students

Suppose you want to add a new "AI Essay Grader" for students:

1. Open `data/services/student.json` and add a new object to the `services` array:

```json
{
  "id": "S-S-8",
  "slug": "ai-essay-grader",
  "name": "AI Essay Grader",
  "description": "Grades student essays using advanced LLMs.",
  "credits": 3,
  "isAvailable": true,
  "input": { "file": { "required": false, "active": true }, "form": { "required": true, "active": true } },
  "processing": { "mode": "assistant", "type": "chat", "assistant": { "baseId": "asst_essayGrader" } },
  "response": { "format": "text", "streaming": true, "annotations": true },
  "icon": { "required": true, "active": true, "sources": { "default": "..." }, "alt": "AI Essay Grader Icon", "type": "image/png" }
}
```

2. Save the file. The backend will automatically recognize and expose the new tool, making it available for use in workflows, chat, or background jobs.

#### Example: Teacher-Specific AI Tools

Similarly, teacher tools like "AI Lesson Plan Generator" or "AI Worksheet Creator" are defined in `data/services/teacher.json` with all their configuration, input requirements, and processing logic specified in JSON.

#### Benefits

- **Ultra-fast prototyping**: New AI features can be added, tested, and iterated in minutes.
- **Zero downtime**: No need to restart or redeploy the backend for most feature changes.
- **Safe experimentation**: Features can be enabled for specific users, classes, or organizations for A/B testing or phased rollout.
- **Rich metadata**: Each tool can have its own icon, description, input/output config, and even organization-specific overrides.

This approach makes VedaAI uniquely agile and future-proof, empowering both developers and non-technical admins to shape the platform’s AI capabilities with ease.
