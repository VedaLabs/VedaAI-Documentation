## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Component Architecture & Design System

- **Atomic, Modular Components:** The codebase leverages a highly modular, atomic component architecture. UI elements are split into reusable, composable units (see `components/`), enabling rapid development and consistent design language.
- **Design System:** All UI elements adhere to a strict design system, ensuring pixel-perfect consistency, accessibility, and theming. Custom icons, UI primitives, and layout components are abstracted for maximum reusability.
- **Layout Abstractions:** Dynamic layouts (e.g., `client-layout.tsx`, `dashboard/layout.tsx`) allow for context-aware rendering, supporting complex dashboard and multi-view experiences.

### State Management Patterns

- **Context API & Custom Stores:** Advanced state management is achieved via React Context and custom store patterns (see `store/SocketContext.tsx`, `store/userDataStore.ts`). This enables global, reactive state with minimal boilerplate and maximum type safety.
- **Custom Hooks:** The `hooks/` directory contains sophisticated hooks (e.g., `useFetch`, `useService`, `useToast`) that abstract data fetching, service orchestration, and UI logic, promoting DRY principles and testability.
- **Scalable Modularization:** Features are organized by domain (`features/`), supporting micro-frontend scalability and independent feature deployment.

### Routing & Navigation

- **Advanced Routing:** Utilizes Next.js App Router for dynamic, nested, and protected routes. Modular route layouts and middleware (`middleware.ts`) enable role-based access, authentication, and deep-linking.
- **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:** All major feature modules are code-split, ensuring only necessary code is loaded per route. This dramatically improves initial load times and user experience.

## Real-time Features & WebSocket Implementation

### Multi-Channel WebSocket Architecture

- **Socket Context:** The `SocketContext.tsx` provides a robust, multi-channel WebSocket connection pool, supporting real-time chat, live classes, notifications, and collaborative editing.
- **Room Management:** Dynamic room/channel management enables users to join/leave multiple real-time sessions (e.g., classrooms, group chats, live events) with seamless reconnection and state sync.
- **Connection Resilience:** Automatic reconnection, exponential backoff, and session restoration ensure uninterrupted real-time experiences, even in unstable network conditions.

### Real-time Collaboration & Analytics

- **Live Collaboration:** Real-time document editing, shared whiteboards, and live class features are powered by synchronized state and event broadcasting across users.
- **Live Notifications:** Channel-specific notification routing ensures users receive only relevant updates, with granular control over notification types and delivery.
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time analytics dashboards update instantly as users interact, providing actionable insights for educators and administrators.

## AI Integration & LLM Management

### Flexible LLM Provider Switching

- **Multi-Provider Architecture:** The platform supports seamless switching between OpenAI, Claude, AWS Bedrock, and custom LLMs. Provider abstraction layers allow for rapid integration of new models and fallback strategies.
- **Custom Model Integration:** Fine-tuned, institution-specific models can be plugged in with minimal code changes, supporting unique educational needs and compliance requirements.

### AI-Powered Features

- **Homework Generator:** Teachers can generate assignments with customizable parameters (difficulty, topic, format) using advanced prompt engineering and LLM orchestration.
- **AI Grader:** Automated grading leverages LLMs for rubric-based, detailed feedback, supporting both objective and subjective assessments.
- **Thread Title & Content Processing:** AI auto-generates thread titles, summaries, and content recommendations, streamlining user workflows and enhancing engagement.
- **Background Media Analysis:** Media uploads are processed in the background using AI for content extraction, moderation, and referencing.
- **Smart Recommendations:** Personalized content and resource recommendations are powered by AI-driven analytics and user behavior modeling.

## Advanced UIUX Features

### Customizable Dashboards & Layouts

- **Dynamic Layouts:** Users experience highly customizable dashboards, with drag-and-drop widgets, personalized views, and institution-specific branding.
- **Theme Switching:** Real-time theme switching (light/dark/custom) is supported, with persistent user preferences and accessibility compliance.

### Data Visualization & Responsiveness

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Advanced charts, progress trackers, and analytics components provide actionable insights with real-time updates.
- **Mobile-First & Responsive:** The UI is fully responsive, optimized for all devices, and tested for accessibility (WCAG compliance).
- **Internationalization:** Built-in i18n/l10n support enables rapid deployment across global institutions.

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching & Resource Management

- **Service Workers & Memory Caching:** Aggressive caching strategies (service workers, in-memory) minimize redundant network requests and enable offline capabilities.
- **Virtual Scrolling:** Large datasets (e.g., student lists, chat logs) are rendered with virtual scrolling for smooth, performant UX.
- **Image Optimization:** All images are lazy-loaded and optimized for device and network conditions.
- **Bundle Optimization:** Tree shaking, code splitting, and dynamic imports ensure minimal bundle sizes and lightning-fast load times.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Integrated analytics and monitoring tools track performance, memory usage, and user flows, enabling proactive optimization.
- **Memory Leak Prevention:** Custom hooks and effect cleanup patterns prevent memory leaks and ensure long-term stability.

## Customization & Configuration

### White-Label & Dynamic Configuration

- **White-Label Ready:** The platform supports institution-specific branding, theming, and workflows, enabling rapid white-label deployments.
- **Dynamic UI Configuration:** UI components and workflows are dynamically configurable via JSON and environment settings, supporting feature toggles and A/B testing.
- **Role-Based Customization:** User roles (admin, teacher, student) drive dynamic UI rendering, permissions, and feature access.
- **Feature Flags:** Granular feature flag system enables safe rollout, experimentation, and rollback of new features.

## Data Management & Processing

### Forms, File Uploads, and Media

- **Complex Form Handling:** Advanced form components support validation, conditional logic, and dynamic fields, ensuring robust data collection.
- **File Uploads:** File uploads feature progress tracking, preview, and background processing for large media files.
- **Media Processing:** Integrated media analysis and manipulation (thumbnails, previews, AI tagging) enhance user experience and content discoverability.
- **Offline & Sync:** Offline-first design with background sync ensures data integrity and seamless user experience during connectivity changes.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Powerful search and filtering systems enable users to quickly find resources, assignments, and messages.
- **Data Export & Reporting:** Users can export data and generate reports in multiple formats, supporting compliance and analytics needs.
